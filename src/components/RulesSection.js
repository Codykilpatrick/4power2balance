        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Team Setup:</strong> Each team can register 4 players. To join the tournament, you need to register 2 players right away, and an additional player can be added later. I don't want to interfere with Team Politics much, but if a player left a team, they will not be able to join any team or earn EP for the tournament placement. If the remaining players decide to recruit a replacement, they are allowed to do this up to two times. This means if 4 player team loses 2 members, the remaining 2 players are allowed to recruit 2 new members to replace the others. If then again, someone leaves the team, the remaining players need to play with an empty spot in their roster. Resulting in a total of 6 players being able to participate for a team. Ideally all teams have their things sorted out and a good stable roster of 3 main players and 1 backUp that can jump in if needed. 
                I hope this ruling gives enough flexibility and still keeps the original identity of teams.</li>
          <li><strong>Swiss System:</strong> Matches will be paired using the Swiss system to ensure balanced matchups.</li>
          <li><strong>Best of 3 (Bo3) Matches:</strong> 7 maps are available. Each team uses 2 bans, with the final 3 maps being played. The ban format is 1-2-1. Decide at random who gets the first ban.</li>
          <li><strong>Victory Conditions:</strong> Most competitive players prefer playing with victory conditions off, so that&apos;s what we&apos;ll go with.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Speed will be x1.5, with all other individual speed settings set to normal.</li>
          <li><strong>Rotating Planets:</strong> Rotation On</li>

            In Bo3 matches, teams can ban the 3v3 maps if they want to play on 2v2 maps. This means a team of 2 players can win the whole tournament.

          Late sign-ups are allowed in Round 1 (if they make the number of teams even). This ensures fair pairings, avoids free wins due to an uneven number of teams, and gives late joiners a chance to participate.
